Disclaimer:
This project has solely an educational purpose and will only be used to complete
the Functional Programming course.

It will not be ready to be used in a real environment, as security (encryption, authorization and authentication) is not the main concern and may or may not be implemented reliably or not at all.

Description:
The project contains trivial server and client implementations written in Clojure.
The server will act as middleman that enables clients to find each other for further
communication.

The clients itself then specify a folder to analyze and compare with the other client's folder content.
Any differences shall be recognized and changes should be updated / synchronized:

Changes prior to the latest synchronization shall not be taken into account.
